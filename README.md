# webDev
This is me uploading my Web Development journey on github,
I'm starting from the very basic html websites but soon I will
work my way up to a full fledged dynamic website.

Through this I'll be learning web dev skills - html, css, javascript, python and django for starters.

This would be complementary practice along with the internet tools lab at my university.

I'm hoping to benefit through this approach just as much as others before me have,
my repositories will also be a looking glass for recruiters,
at the very least this excercise will be a measure of my consistency.
